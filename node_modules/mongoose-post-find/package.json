  "readme": "# mongoose-post-find\n\nThis is a mongoose plugin to enable post find and findOne hooks to modify results before they are returned from Model.find, Model.findOne, and Model.find().exec.\n\n## Usage\n\n```javascript\npostFind = require('mongoose-post-find')\n\nYourSchema.plugin(postFind, {\n\n  find: function(results, done) {\n    //Do work on the results\n    done(null, results) //Results must be passed to callback\n  },\n\n  //You can also pass in an array of post hooks, \n  //they will run in the order the array is in.\n  findOne: [ \n\n    function(result, done) {\n      //Do something to the result\n      done(null, result)\n    },\n\n    function(result, done) {\n      //Do something to the result\n      done(null, result)\n    }\n\n  ]\n\n})\n```\n\nNow you can use `Model.find` and `Model.findOne` just as you'd normally do.\n\n```javascript\nYourModel.find({}, function(err, results) {\n  //Do things\n})\n\nYourModel.findOne({}).lean().sort('thing').exec(function(err, results) {\n  //Do things\n})\n```\n\n## License\nCopyright (c) 2013 i.TV LLC\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
